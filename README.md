This project demonstrates my ability to use **Excel** for:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Pivot tables and chart creation
- Dashboard design and storytelling with data

- The most common ratings are TV-MA (for adults) and TV-14 (for teens and young adults).  
- Content ranges from 1925 to 2021, but the fastest growth happened in the 2010s when Netflix expanded worldwide.  
- The United States has the most titles, but India, UK, and Canada also add a lot of content.  
- International movies are increasing, showing Netflixâ€™s effort to reach more global viewers.  


## Tools & Skills Used
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, pivot tables, slicers, and charts  
- **Data Analysis**: Finding patterns, growth, and audience focus
